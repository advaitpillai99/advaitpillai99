# 👋 Hey, I’m Advait

I'm building toward a career at the intersection of data, strategy, and product - using analytics to understand people and power better decisions. I'm currently pursuing my MS in Business Analytics at Boston University, with a growing toolkit at the intersection of analytics, machine learning, and business storytelling. I’m obsessed with how data drives decisions, and I build projects that reflect that curiosity.

## 🧠 What I Bring

- 📊 **Data Analytics & Storytelling:** Skilled in translating messy data into structured, insight-rich visuals and models
- 🧪 **Hands-on Projects:** From predictive modeling to NLP, regression, classification, and dashboarding - I build it all from scratch
- 🌐 **Cloud & Scale:** Spark on AWS EC2, data pipelines, GitHub workflows - I like building with production in mind
- 🎯 **Business Context:** Every model I build is tied to a real-world use case: revenue, pricing, consumer behavior, growth
